1. The Association shall maintain and present the The Howard Stavely Teaching
   Award; The President’s Award; and the Gradum Dominus Machinarum Award

## The Howard Stavely Teaching Award

1. Howard Staveley started working at Queen's University in 1966. He became an
   adjunct instructor for the department of Computing and Information Science
   at Queen's University in 1982 and continued teaching until the winter term
   of 1996. He also held the position of Manager of Information Systems in
   Computing Services from 1982 until 1996. Howard passed away in 1996 at the
   age of 52, in the midst of a successful career. He has been sorely missed by
   his many friends at Queen's. In 1997 an annual award was created in his
   memory. 
2. Howard consistently earned outstanding evaluations from his classes, and
   established a standard for teaching excellence. Students loved Howard
   because he was a great instructor who loved teaching. He was not a teacher
   by profession -- he took on the role over and above his full-time job with
   Queen's Computing and Communication Services (now called Information
   Technology Services). Howard brought to his classes his own enthusiasm, his
   respect for the students, and his appreciation for the humanity in the
   science. Nominees should demonstrate the same love and enthusiasm for
   teaching, care for students, and outstanding feedback from students as
   Howard did. 
3. Students may submit a signed nomination for a professor via e-mail or
   another appropriate method. 
4. Notification of this award and the ability for students to nominate
   professors, shall be sent via e-mail at least twice per year, once at the
   end of the fall term, and once at the end of the winter term, by the
   Executive. 
5. The Association’s Council shall review all nominations in a closed session,
   and determine the final award recipient. 
6. This award will be presented annually at the School of Computing Awards
   Ceremony by the President of the Association (or designate).

   most contributed to the betterment of the University experience for COMPSA

2. One recipient shall be any member of COMPSA who does not sit on Council and
   has demonstrated spirit and enthusiasm for everything COMPSA. The President
   shall collect recommendations for this award via e-mail or another
   appropriate method at least two weeks before the award is to be presented;
   the President shall review these recommendations and determine the award
   recipient.
3. This award shall be presented to two recipients each a year at the End of
   Year Computing Banquet.

   their time at Queen’s, contributed to the betterment of the University
   experience and demonstrated spirit and enthusiasm for everything COMPSA.
