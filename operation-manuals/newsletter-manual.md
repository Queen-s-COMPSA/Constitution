## Schedule 

The newsletters are released on a schedule such that:

| Type      | Frequency     | Day    | starts on                  |
|-----------|---------------|--------|----------------------------|
| Internal  | Biweekly      | Friday | Friday before the first GA |
| Student   | Every 3 Weeks | Monday | Monday of the first GA     |

# Process

## 1. Internal Newsletter
1. Collect info from Directors & Presidents about what is coming up / going
   on for each portfolio in the week before the newsletter is due
2. Write it all down nicely in a markdown file in this repo
3. Send it in a Discord server announcement, starting the firday before the
   first


## 2. Maintain Monthly Student Newsletter
1. Summarize the last 2 Internal Newsletters to include only things
   important to students, making it quick and easy to read
2. Also summarize the most recent GA's minutes to give updates and bring
   awareness to the GA
3. Write the final draft up in `$EMAIL_LIST_SENDING_SOFTWARE` and send to
   `$COMPUTING_STUDENT_EMAIL_LIST`, starting on the day of the first
   GA (afterwards, in order to allow the minutes to be added)
